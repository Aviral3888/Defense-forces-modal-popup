# Defense Forces Project
### A modal pop-up project
- HTML, CSS, Javascript
- Responsive 

### Project Overview
If you love our defence forces and want to know about them and in an ***interesting*** and in ***picturesque*** manner.            
This is your place.

### Working 
There are 4 boxes of width 50% and height 50% in each corner.                
Each box has a different picture and depicts a category of defence force like ***Army, Air Force, Navy and Special Forces***          
Once you click any box anywhere in that area a modal pop-up appears.                                                                    
Modal Pop-up has **Width : 75%** and **Height : 80vh**. It contains an image in the left section and some text on right section.                              
There is a cross button in the modal pop-up. Clicking anywhere outside the modal and on the cross buton the modal disappears.
